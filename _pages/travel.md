### Dalhousie Trek #YHAI

It was the winters of 2018 when the idea of Dalhousie trek came into action. I was about to graduate and had 5 months before I was about to graduate. That's when I thought of doing something exciting so that we would have great memories look back. We went through the available options and saw this amazing trek for three days which took us to the mesmerising place - Dalhousie.
