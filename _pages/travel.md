### Dalhousie Trek #YHAI

It was the winters of 2018 when the idea of Dalhousie trek came into action. I was about to graduate and had 5 months before I was about to graduate. That's when I thought of doing something exciting so that we would have great memories look back. We went through the available options and saw this amazing trek for three days which took us to the mesmerising place - Dalhousie.

This trip looks so much like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara XD but I would say this has more resemblance to Hobbit's journey to Misty Mountains. Our trip started from Mumbai, Maharashtra to the destination Dalhousie base camp. We decided to fly to Dalhousie which was quite a standard plan but we couldn't find a direct flight from Mumbai to Dalhousie. Instead we got a flight from Mumbai - Delhi - Jammu which proved to be quite unreal but since we had put enough thought over it. This was the moment for:

"Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To find our long-forgotten gold"

This was the first sight for the great "Himalayas" - The Misty Mountains.
