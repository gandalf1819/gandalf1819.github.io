### Dalhousie Trek #YHAI

Under progress

<!-- It was the winters of 2018 when the idea of Dalhousie trek came into action. I was about to graduate and had 5 months before I was about to graduate. That's when I thought of doing something exciting so that we would have great memories look back. We went through the available options and saw this amazing trek for three days which took us to the mesmerising place - Dalhousie.

I would say this trip has resemblance to Hobbit's journey to Misty Mountains. Our trip started from Mumbai, Maharashtra to the destination Dalhousie base camp. We decided to fly to Dalhousie which was quite a standard plan but we couldn't find a direct flight from Mumbai to Dalhousie. Instead we got a flight from Mumbai - Delhi - Jammu which proved to be quite unreal but since we had put enough thought over it. This was the moment for:

"Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To find our long-forgotten gold"

# Mordor - Kalatop 
# Khal dum - Dalhousie
# 3rd day - Khajiar lake 

This was the first sight for the great "Himalayas" - The Misty Mountains. The journey later took a quick turn as the journey which lay ahead was more adventurous as we travelled via bus rather than train. The next destination before reaching Dalhousie was Pathankot. The journey proved to be an amazing one as we could see all the beautiful places on the way to Pathankot.  -->
