### Chinmay Wyawahare

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at New York University. 

I am in search of internship and Full-time positions in the fields of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, DevOps and Software Development.

On weekend, I spend a lot of time working on Data Science projects, gaming, photographing and more importantly cooking new and creative recipes to improve my culinary skills ;).
