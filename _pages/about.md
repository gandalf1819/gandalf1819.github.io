### Chinmay Wyawahare

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at New York University. 

I am in search of internship and Full-time positions in the fields of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, DevOps and Software Development.

On weekends, I spend a lot of time working on Data Science projects, gaming, hiking and photographing.

I like to listen to all sorts of genres of music. A big time fan of [The Strokes](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53XhwfbYqKCa1cC15pYq2q), [Imagine Dragons](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53XhwfbYqKCa1cC15pYq2q),[Bridgit Mendler](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4VhL8KLjVso4vLfOLVViTb?autoplay=true&v=A) and [alt-J](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3XHO7cRUPCLOr6jwp8vsx5?autoplay=true&v=A).
