### Chinmay Wyawahare

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at New York University. 

I am in search of internship positions in the fields of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, DevOps and Software Development.

I spend a lot of time working on Data Science projects, gaming and photographing.
