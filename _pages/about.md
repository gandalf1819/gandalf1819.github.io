### Chinmay Wyawahare

Machine Learning enthusiast with a deep fascination for relational mathematics and pattern recognition.   
Currently a graduate student at New York University pursuing Masters in Computer Science with an inclination towards distributed systems, BigData and Data Science. I love building products using existing and emerging technologies.

Always enthusiastic about learning and exploring new technologies. Looking for opportunities in the fields of software engineering, data engineering and data science.

On weekends, I spend a lot of time working on Data Science projects, gaming, hiking and photographing.

I like to listen to all sorts of genres of music. A big time fan of [The Strokes](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53XhwfbYqKCa1cC15pYq2q), [Imagine Dragons](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53XhwfbYqKCa1cC15pYq2q), [Bridgit Mendler](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4VhL8KLjVso4vLfOLVViTb?autoplay=true&v=A) and [alt-J](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3XHO7cRUPCLOr6jwp8vsx5?autoplay=true&v=A).
